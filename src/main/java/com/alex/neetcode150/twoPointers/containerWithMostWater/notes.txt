11. Container With Most Water
=========================================

You are given an integer array height of length n.
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.


Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above (img) vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1



===================
Solution
===================

The solution to this is very similar to the twoSum2 (sorted array input) solution.

Have a pointer at each end of the array, moving inwards.
We want to find the MAXIMUM area. So, on each iteration, determine which side has the smaller height,
then move that pointer inward by 1 (reason is, current position already has the maximum area for this being one of the heights.
i.e. on each iteration, the smaller height is the limiting factor).

Calculate the are on each iteration, and find the maximum.
