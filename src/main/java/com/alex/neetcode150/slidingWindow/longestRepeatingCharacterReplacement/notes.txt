424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
===================================================

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other
uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.


Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.


===================
Solution
===================

We want to find the longest repeating character substring, allowing k mistakes.

We can do this by using a sliding window. You start from the beginning and stretch it as far as possible.
Along the way, you keep count of the most common character in the window. If at any point the size of the window
minus the count of the most common character is more than k, move the start of the window (and decrease the count of
the previous start char by one).

We can use an int array to hold the char counts.
