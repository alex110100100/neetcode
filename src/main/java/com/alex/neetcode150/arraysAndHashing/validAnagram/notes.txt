===================
242 - Valid Anagram
===================

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Solution
===================

2 Main ways to solve this:


1 - Sort both strings alphabetically, then just check if they are equal.
    If using a language other than Java (where Strings are immutable), this may be the most space-efficient method.

    Sorting algorithms, either: HeapSort Space O(1) | QuickSort Space O(log(N))
    So:
    Time O(N * logN) | Space O(N)


2 - Create a HashMap (or array of integers to hold ascii values), to hold counts of each character.
    then iterate over both strings in one go.
    You can add 1 to the count for a character if it is in string1,
    substract 1 from the count for a character if it is in string1,

    Time O(N) | Space O(1)
