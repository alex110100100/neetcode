Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true




===================
Solution
===================

A few potential ways to solve this:

1 - For each element, compare it all the elements after it and check if they match.
    This is this first solution that comes to mind, but it isn't very efficient.

    Time complexity:    O(n^2)
    Space complexity:   O(1)


2 - Sort the elements, then iterate once and compare each element with its neighbour.

    Time complexity:    O(nLogn)
    Space complexity:   O(1)


3 - Iterate over the elements, adding them to a hashset as you go.

    Time complexity:    O(n)
    Space complexity:   O(n)
