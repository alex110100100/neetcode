128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
===================================

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9



===================================
Solution
===================================

To find the LONGEST sequence in the array,
we just need to compare the lengths of all distinct sequences (sub-sequences won't concern us)

To find determine different sequences in the array, we can search for the starting number of each sequence.
note that if a number n from the array is the first number in a sequence, then n-1 will not be present in the array.
So, we want to iterate through the array, and looks for numbers where n-1 is not present
(to check if a given num is present, we'd first create a HashSet containing all the nums from the original array).

Once we find such an element, we just keep adding 1 to it, and checking if that result is also present in the hashset.
If it isn't, then we know that's the end of this sequence. We take a note of its length, and compare it with the longest
sequence length found so far.
