===================
49 - Group Anagrams
===================

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]



===================
Solution
===================

We have a list of Strings...

To group the anagrams together, we need to consider 2 things:
    1 - how to determine whether 2 strings are anagrams
    2 - how to group together many anagrams

To determine anagrams, we can we keep track of the number of each character
in a strings, and then compare with that of the other strings.

For each String, we can store the character frequencies in an array.
We can then use that as a key in a hashmap. This way, anagrams will be saved
as values for that key.
(Note that we need to convert the array into a String before using it as
a hashmap key, so that we can compare it with the char counts of other Strings.
This is because comparing to arrays would compare the address rather than its values).


Time O(M * N)   because we have N avg characters per string, which we iterate over to add to array
                and there are M strings, so we have to do that M times

Space O(M * N)
