You can often trade space for better time complexity.

e.g. Creating a hashset can be a fast way to check for duplicates in an array (see containsDuplicate)


Remember, if you need to search for an element, and you want to keep time complexity low,
then you might want to consider first copying all the elements into a hashset, and then checking if the hashset contains
the element you're searching for.
